1. Go to folder where you want to create data base. In my case I created cscope data base of SSNIC driver and C-model separately.
	Ex: cd /home/pakteam/Mukesh/Sahil_Git/FPGA-Driver-Software/components/nic/linux/driver
2. Create cscope data base
	cscope -Rb
3. Create ctags data base	
	ctags -R *
4. run cscope 
	cscope -p10 -d
5. There are different search oprions in cscope commnad display.
		seach by function, search by string, search by file etc.
6. To move inside the function	
			CTRL + }
7. To move backword 
			CTRL + T
8. To move start of the function
		{ + {


You can defien cscope editor by adding below in ~/.bashrc
	export CSCOPE_EDITOR=/bin/vim
